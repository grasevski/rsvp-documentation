The Smart Services Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) is a major research collaboration between major industry (media and finance), government and university partners. As part of its program, Smart Services CRC awards student scholarships for work associated with its various research programs. As a successful scholarship applicant, I was assigned various tasks pertaining to the CRC's research work on content filtering and recommender systems, focusing specifically on the RSVP dating website.

RSVP, owned by Smart Services partner Fairfax Media, is an online dating website which is free to sign up, but charges a fee for subsequent chat interactions, however the user is free to send predefined messages to other users. To increase the number of chat sessions (and thus overall profit), RSVP developed a recommender system, with ``suggested contacts" which had an above average chance of:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item being liked by the user, and
  \item the user being liked by them.
\end{enumerate}

Smart Services was tasked with investigating various strategies and improvements for the RSVP recommender system. My work, which has been achieved at the UNSW Kensington campus primarily under the instruction of postdoctorate researchers Alfred Kryzywicki and Yang Sok Kim respectively, has consisted of the following tasks:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Feature extraction from the user-entered free text
  \item Extraction and reporting of statistics from the trial
  \item Extraction, reporting and analysis of homophily statistics
\end{enumerate}

Each of these tasks are explained in depth in the following report.

\chapter{Training}
My training on the job was not particularly formal, but was very helpful. Since working for Smart Services, I have learnt various technical, analytical and organizational skills.

I had no experience with Oracle database or JDBC prior to my ITE, and despite having learned SQL and having used similar DBMS' such as Nexus, PostgreSQL and MySQL, my lack of experience with Oracle was a setback. My supervisors were very helpful and informative with their suggestions on how to approach this side of the project and gave me various pointers on SQL testing and optimisation. Prior to this job I had minimal experience of unit testing database interactions, but have since learned various pragmatic approaches to testing the validity of SQL queries

\chapter{Relationship to studies}
My experience at Smart Services CRC has given me the opportunity to put much of the mathematical, computational and engineering theory into practice.
